PPO Hyperparameter Sweep

Overview

This repository demonstrates a full deep reinforcement learning (RL) engineering workflow for training and optimizing a custom PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) agent on a multi-agent treasure hunt environment. The core feature of this project is a robust, reproducible automated hyperparameter sweep—a critical tool for achieving high-performing, stable RL agents in complex domains.
Key Features

    Modular PPO Implementation
    All core RL components are modularized for easy experimentation and clarity:

        ppo_agent.py: PPO training loop, advantage estimation, update logic

        ppo_policy.py: Neural policy/value network (supports CNN/MLP, orthogonal init, normalization, etc.)

        run_ppo.py: Command-line interface for training agents with flexible parameterization

    Automated Hyperparameter Sweep
    Launches parallel or sequential training runs over a defined grid of hyperparameter settings (learning rate, entropy, GAE lambda, etc.), optionally with multi-seed averaging for robust statistical results.

    Reproducibility & Logging
    All runs are logged to separate directories for each configuration/seed. Results are tracked for average reward, episode lengths, and success rates, enabling rapid analysis and reproducibility.

    Example Results and Analysis
    Includes sample sweep logs, configuration files, and result summaries—demonstrating how to analyze and select optimal hyperparameter regions for future production or research use.

Why Hyperparameter Sweeps Matter

Most RL agents are extremely sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters. A systematic, automated sweep is essential for:

    Ensuring consistent, high-quality learning

    Avoiding local optima or unstable training runs

    Discovering which parameters most impact performance

    Demonstrating scientific rigor and reproducibility

This project provides a template and practical guidance for running large-scale sweeps—mirroring professional workflows in AI research labs and advanced engineering teams.
