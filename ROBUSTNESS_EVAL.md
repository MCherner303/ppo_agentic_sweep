# Robustness Evaluation: PPO Agentic Sweep

This document details the robustness evaluation workflow and results for the PPO agentic sweep framework. It provides a deep-dive into the methods used to ensure reliable, stable PPO training across multiple seeds and hyperparameter settings.

---

## Motivation

During large-scale PPO hyperparameter sweeps, some configurations and seeds can produce NaN/Inf losses, unstable updates, or runs that freeze/hang. Robust evaluation is essential to:
- Identify truly stable configs
- Avoid misleading results from a single lucky seed
- Ensure reproducibility and reliability

---

## Workflow Summary

1. **Skip/Abort Failing Seeds**
    - Training is immediately aborted if NaN/Inf is detected in any loss/metric.
    - The evaluation script skips seeds that fail (detected by `[ABORT]` in logs).
2. **Lower Learning Rates**
    - Both actor and critic learning rates were reduced (to `3e-5`) to improve stability.
3. **Reward Normalization**
    - Rewards are normalized to zero mean and unit variance before PPO update, reducing risk of instability.
4. **Multi-Seed Evaluation**
    - The top config is evaluated on 10 new random seeds, logging results for each.
5. **Iterative Tuning**
    - If instability persists, further tweaks are applied (e.g., more normalization, grid narrowing).

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Run Robust Multi-Seed Evaluation

```bash
bash run_top_config_seeds.sh
```
- This script launches the best PPO config on seeds 1001â€“1010.
- Each run logs to `logs/top_config_repeats/top_config_seed_<SEED>.log`.
- If a run fails with NaN/Inf, it is marked as skipped and does not pollute results.

### 2. Inspect Results

- All logs should be small and end with `Training completed!`.
- Example output for a successful run:

```
Starting PPO training...
Device: cuda
Agents: ['agent_0', 'agent_1']
...
Saved models at episode 10000
Training completed!
```

- If a log contains `[ABORT] NaN/Inf detected...`, that seed/config was unstable and skipped.

### 3. What Changed (Technical Details)

- `train_ppo.py` now aborts on NaN/Inf and exits with `sys.exit(1)`.
- `run_top_config_seeds.sh` skips seeds with `[ABORT]` in their log.
- Reward normalization is performed in `PPOTrainer` before PPO update.
- Learning rates are set to `3e-5` for both actor and critic.

---

## Results (as of commit efb6249)

- All 10 seeds for the top config completed successfully without NaN/Inf aborts.
- No large log files were produced; all logs are concise and clean.
- This confirms the config is robust and suitable for further study or deployment.

---

## Recommendations for Future Sweeps

- Always run multi-seed evaluation before claiming a config is robust.
- Use reward normalization and conservative learning rates for new environments.
- Periodically review logs for `[ABORT]` or other instability signals.
- Document any new robustness tricks or tweaks here for future users.
